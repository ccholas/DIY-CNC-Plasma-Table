# DIY-CNC-Plasma-Table
This is a project for building you own CNC Plasma Cutting table using Arduino UNO and Raspberry Pi platforms. I started out looking to build a Plasma Cutter Table using an old Ez3D printer platform that I had sitting int he basement. I have started this project completely ignorant of how to build a plaatform like this and even to make it function. I have read many different websites claiming instructions on how to build a CNC. But I found them to be confusing and incomplete with the information that you need to build the system. This is a work in progress and I hope that it helps someone else achieve their goals of building a plasma cutting platform.

There are lots of options for you to choose from. I am going to include my approach to the table and the parts I used. If you follow my plans you will have everything you need to build the platform. I have a Lulzbot Mini 3D printer and printed out all of the motor mounts, bearings, Z-Axis, etc. I have included all of those STL files in this project. Please refer to the BOM.xls file for specific ordering information.
